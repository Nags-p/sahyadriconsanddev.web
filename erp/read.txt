Of course. It's smart to have a clear blueprint of the user interface before you start building. Here is a breakdown of the key pages, sections, and features for your custom-built ERP, focusing on the Employee Management module first.

Think of the ERP as a separate, secure section of your admin panel. When a user with the right permissions logs in, they'll see new navigation items for these pages.

ERP Navigation Sidebar Structure

Your existing dashboard sidebar can be extended. The new "ERP" section would be visible only to authorized users (e.g., HR, Admin).
